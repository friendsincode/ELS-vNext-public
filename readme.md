# Welcome to ELS vNext!

This is a complete rewrite of ELS Plus in typescript compatible for both platforms. This has been redone from the ground up for efficiency and portablility. We have also made it even easier to add VCF files support multiple vehicle resources and the over 900 patterns you have already known and loved.
